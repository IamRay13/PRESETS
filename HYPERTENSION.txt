Managing high blood pressure (hypertension) involves lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication. Here are some effective ways to lower blood pressure naturally:  

- Maintain a Healthy Diet: Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing salt and processed foods.  
- Exercise Regularly: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity, like walking or swimming, most days of the week.  
- Reduce Stress: Practice relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.  
- Limit Alcohol & Caffeine: Excessive alcohol and caffeine intake can raise blood pressure.  
- Quit Smoking: Smoking damages blood vessels and increases hypertension risk.  
- Get Enough Sleep: Poor sleep can contribute to high blood pressure, so aim for 7â€“9 hours per night.

If high blood pressure continues untreated, it can lead to serious health complications over time. Here are some potential effects:  

- Heart Problems: Hypertension forces the heart to work harder, increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and heart failure.  
- Stroke Risk: High blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the brain, leading to strokes or cognitive decline.  
- Kidney Damage: The kidneys rely on healthy blood flow, and hypertension can impair their function, potentially leading to kidney failure.  
- Vision Issues: High blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the eyes, increasing the risk of vision loss.  
- Aneurysms: Prolonged hypertension can weaken arteries, leading to dangerous aneurysms.
